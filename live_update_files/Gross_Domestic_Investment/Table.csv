Legend/Footnotes
1. Gross government investment consists of general government and government enterprise expenditures for fixed assets; change in inventories is included in government consumption expenditures.
"Note. Most chained (2017) dollar series are calculated as the product of the chain-type quantity index and the 2017 current-dollar value of the corresponding series, divided by 100. Because the formula for the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one period, the corresponding chained-dollar estimates are usually not additive. Chained (2017) dollar estimates of net investment are calculated by subtracting consumption of fixed capital from gross investment."
